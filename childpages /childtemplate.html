I listed many goals in the letter that I made, the one goal that was the most important I had on that list is “ win one award “. Thankfully I have achieved that when in grade 9 I was awarded the “R.Krawchuck Award for Exceptional Individual growth”. I will never forget that day, it was amazing and
        was extremely happy afterwards.</p>

          <p style="font-size:2.4vw"><em><b>My School Jounery:</b>  </em>My school journey is very complicated, I had a hard time in school for many reasons. I started talking when I was 7 years old so going to school and speaking was pretty hard for me, I messed up a lot of words and grammar when I would talk like I would say “goed” rather than went sometimes. When I was in grade 3 I switched to another school and into a program called  “opportunities program” to help me with speaking and school in general, everyone there was super nice and I loved elementary there. When I had to go to middle school, it was different I went to a different program called “Strategies” and I found out I had a learning disability specific a reading disability that made it hard for me to read anything. After 2 years in the program, I got better and decided in grade 9 to switch to normal classes for the first time. </p>
