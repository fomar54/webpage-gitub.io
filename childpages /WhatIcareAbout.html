<p style="font-size:2.5vw"> I care about the environment for several reasons, I started looking into the environment when I was on a school project about climate change. When I was researching the environment for this project, I learned the impacts we as humans were putting on the environment as climate change, pollution and deforestation from industrial pants to food and technology waste and driving cars even. Animal habitats are in danger because of those impacts of global warming and pesticides, bees are now endangered species because of pesticides. Biodiversity is very important for our environment because biodiversity provides functioning ecosystems that supply oxygen, clean air and water, pollination of plants, pest control, wastewater treatment and many ecosystem services. I don’t see a lot of people focusing on those impacts or even trying to fix their habits for the sake of the world and that’s why I care about the environment.
