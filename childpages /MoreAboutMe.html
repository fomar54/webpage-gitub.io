        <p style="font-size:1.8vw"> My ethnicity is Somalian, my father was born there and also my mother. I visited Somalia before in 2017 it’s very pretty and has nice people. All of my family from my mother’s side, my aunts and uncles and grandma lives there so it was nice seeing them and seeing where my mom grew up </p>

        <p style="font-size:3.2vw"> Where I was Born  </P>
          <p style="font-size:1.8vw">  I was born in Cairo Egypt I lived there till I was 5 years old. Obviously, I can remember some things about when I was in Egypt, how pretty it was and how nice the people were also I remember my house that I lived in but I only know it has blue walls. When I tell people I was born in Cairo Egypt they always ask me if I saw a mummy before and it makes me laugh every single time or they ask me how I lived there if it’s all sand, not knowing Egypt has grass. The surprising part for me is finding out what winter is and how cold it is in Canada at that time also found out that my brithday December 25th is in winter.</p>
